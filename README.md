# DNSCrypt Completely Blacklist

DNSCrypt is powerfull dns changer tools. I liked blacklist feature, just using *ads* we can block any domains or subdomain with the word "ads", how many list of that?
Here Completely Blacklist for major ads, analytic and tracker.
Specially for privacy, that block malware sites, crypto mining, spyware, telemetry, and others.

# Source
 - Reguler
 - My eXperimental
 - OISD Full
 - Indonesia Ads (fully)
 - Exodus
 - Big Company (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Alibaba, others)
 - Phone Manufacturs
 - Services Online
 - Extremely random words of domain

# Note
I respect our privacy but i know, everyone never leave big company. So i created whitelist for access just that sites.

I'm not haters of ads but sometimes terrible with that
